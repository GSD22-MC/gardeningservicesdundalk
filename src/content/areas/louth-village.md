## Gardening Services in Louth Village

Louth Village holds a unique place in Irish history as the tiny settlement that gave the entire county its name, making it one of the smallest county capitals anywhere in Ireland. Tucked away in the rolling hills west of Dundalk, this quiet rural community has a proud heritage, a well-maintained church, and a collection of homes that reflect generations of local life. Properties in and around Louth Village often feature country gardens with established hedgerows, mature planting, and generous plots.
