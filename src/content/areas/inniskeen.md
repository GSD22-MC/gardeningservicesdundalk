## Frequently Asked Questions About Gardening Services in Inniskeen

### How much does garden clearance cost in Inniskeen?

The cost of garden clearance in Inniskeen depends on the size of the garden and how overgrown it has become. A garden that has been left for a few months will cost less to clear than one that has been neglected for years. Pete and Seamus visit your property free of charge, assess the work required, and provide a fair written quote before any work begins.

### Do you offer regular garden maintenance in Inniskeen?

Yes, we provide regular garden maintenance to customers in the Inniskeen area. We can arrange scheduled visits for grass cutting, hedge trimming, border care, and seasonal tidy-ups on a fortnightly or monthly basis. Regular maintenance keeps your garden in great condition and is often more cost-effective than periodic large-scale clean-ups.

### Can you help with an overgrown garden in Inniskeen?

Absolutely. We regularly clear overgrown gardens in Inniskeen and the surrounding countryside. Rural properties in particular can become overgrown quickly due to the fertile soil and damp conditions in this part of the country. Pete and Seamus will clear back the growth, remove all green waste and debris from the site, and return the garden to a clean, usable state. We can then help you plan the next steps, whether that is fresh landscaping, a new lawn, or a regular maintenance schedule to keep things tidy.
