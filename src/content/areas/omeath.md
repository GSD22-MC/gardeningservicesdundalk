## Gardening Services in Omeath

Pete and Seamus are happy to bring their gardening expertise to Omeath, the Gaeltacht village on the southern shore of Carlingford Lough. Known for its mountain walks and waterfront setting, Omeath is a special part of north Louth where well-tended gardens complement the natural beauty of the surroundings. We offer landscaping, grass cutting, hedge trimming, decking, paving, and complete garden clearance for homes throughout the village and its environs. Our father and son team travels regularly from Dundalk to the Cooley area. Contact Gardening Services Dundalk for a free quote today.
