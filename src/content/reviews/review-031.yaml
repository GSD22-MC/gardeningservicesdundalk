Communication was very fast, quotation clear and well priced, and the team worked unbelievably hard to give me the garden of my dreams. They are very knowledgeable, deal with any issues that crop up along the way without fuss, and are just lovely to interact with. Really tidy and well finished work. Book them - you won't be disappointed!"
