text: "Can't recommend Seamus and crew enough.  Customer service from initial contact was so good I cynically thought it was too good to be true.   He turned up when he said he would and even phoned when running 10mins late for first appointment. He came back with price when he said he would . He started job when he said he would . His workmanship is brilliant and offered great advice and ideas.  The good humour and respectful manner of he and his team around our home made the job a very positive experience.  Only negative is he didn't provide us with the summer weather to allow us to enjoy more of our beautiful deck . We are very happy customers and would highly recommend Seamus and co."
