text: "I recently had Seamus and his team install a new fence, and I’m delighted with the result. They were punctual, efficient, and very friendly from the moment they arrived. Seamus is great craic – and he and the lads are incredibly knowledgeable about plants; they offered brilliant advice on how to revive some of mine that were struggling. They worked hard, left everything spotless, and made the whole process an absolute pleasure. I highly recommend Seamus and his team to anyone looking for fence or garden work – I'd give 10 stars if I could and I will definitely be getting them back for more work."
