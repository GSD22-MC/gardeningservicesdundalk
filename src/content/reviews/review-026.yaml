text: "I found Seamus and his team online and wanted some decking done in my back garden. I knew that I'd need to book it in advance but he was able to do it quicker than he had indicated which was great. The work was done really quickly with the team working two long days to get it finished quicker than expected, it looks great and finished really well and they did a great job tidying up afterwards and left everything really neat and tidy. Very happy with the job and would highly recommend."
