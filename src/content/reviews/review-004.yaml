name: "Excellent work, from start to finish"
text: "Can't recommend Seamus and his crew enough. Arrived on time to quote the job, turned up on time to start the job and worked solidly until it was completed. Very neat work (fence replacement, lawn works and constructing concrete planters), with everything cleaned down and tidied every night. Was very flexible with our design and we have ended up with something we are really happy with. I will use Seamus again and definitely recommend him."
