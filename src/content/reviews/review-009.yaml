name: "Fantastic job!"
text: "I first used Seamus and his team in September to cut my hedging which hadn’t been cut in quite a while and needed some TLC. Seamus gave me a price straight away, told me when he was coming and was true to his word. He also told me because it hasn’t been cut in some time that May  not look great initially but would grow back stronger. I appreciated his honesty. His team were highly efficient and professional. Great attention to detail and genuinely very friendly. I recently contacted him again to plant some shrubs and tidy and trim my existing plantings. I thought perhaps they were only interested in bigger jobs but in Seamus words’ no job too big or too small’.  Yet again he did a fantastic job. He worked through the belting rain to get it done. Took away all the cuttings and left the place in great shape.  I have no hesitation in recommending Seamus and his team."
