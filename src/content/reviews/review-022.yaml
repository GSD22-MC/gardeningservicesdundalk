text: "Delighted with the job Seamus and his crew did recently. I needed to tidy up a tricky and tall hedge at kind of short notice before we put our house on the market. It was a pleasure to deal with him, he was friendly, efficient and so tidy! The place looks great and I'd be happy to recommend him to anyone."
