text: "Dundalk Gardening Service provides a really excellent hard and soft landscaping service. From chatting to Seamus at initial enquiry stages, through to consultation and delivery of a really smart decking solution in my garden – Seamus and Pete were very professional, respectful and friendly.   The quality of craftsmanship and the ease in which the project was delivered was highly commendable and I will have no hesitation in recommending them for their services."
