text: "We recently had Séamus, Pete and team install new fencing and hedging for us. They were an absolute pleasure to deal with from start to finish and extremely professional. They always arrived exactly when was agreed, even working through snow and rain to get the job done, and completed work to a phenomenal standard with very high-quality materials. It is testament to their work that several neighbours and friends were immediately asking us for their contact details, as well as passers-by who have pulled up at the house to take a look. We will certainly be asking them to come back to complete more work for us and would highly recommend them to anyone."
