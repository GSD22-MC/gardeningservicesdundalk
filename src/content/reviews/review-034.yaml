name: "Turned my old house into a dream cottage!"
text: "Seamus and the team changed my drab, untidy gardens and drive around my little house into a gorgeous Irish Cottage Setting. With innovative use of old railway sleepers, some timber work for log store, gravel and some beautiful huge old granite stones him and the team made me proud. Total confidence in this man and his great team. Was fun to have them around too - great characters. Like others have said - happy to use my place as an example for people to see."
