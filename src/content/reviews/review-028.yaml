text: "Séamus and his team were fantastic, friendly and very professional. After buying our home we found the garden had been quite overgrown and was too much for us to tackle on our own. Séamus and his team came in and after walking through the various planting we wanted to retain and what we just wanted gone they set to work. We are so happy with the work they did and would definetly use Sèamus and his team again for any gardening or landscaping work."
