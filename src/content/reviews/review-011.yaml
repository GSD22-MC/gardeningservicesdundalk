name: "Fence down after storm"
text: "Had a complete fence down after storm rang Seamus and despite being extremely busy came out that night to assess the damage. Carried out a temporary repair the next day and came back this week to complete the permanent repair. He and his crew  had repair complete within days at a reasonable cost and excellent workmanship. Would recommend to anyone."
