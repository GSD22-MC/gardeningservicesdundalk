text: "Seamus and the team built a fence and garden gates.  The attention to detail was superb and they were full of brilliant ideas.  Arrived early every morning and worked so hard to make the garden safe for our children.  Seamus checked everything with me, making sure I was happy before he moved on to the next phase. Very reasonably priced, we will definitely use them again in the future.   Seamus is a gentleman and very professional."
