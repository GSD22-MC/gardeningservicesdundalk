text: "From start to finish I am very happy with how my garden looks now. Seamus runs a very professional outfit. Came to see the work at the time he said he would. Went though the entire garden with me and gave good advice on what needed to be done. Came and did the work with 2 good workers under difficult conditions. A complete transformation. I have no hesitation in recommending him. He is pleasant honest and hard working ."
