If there is one plant that has caused more neighbourly grief than any other, it is leylandii. These towering conifers can shoot up to 20 metres or more if left unchecked, blocking light, dominating skylines, and turning garden disputes into bitter stand-offs that last for years.

We have dealt with hundreds of leylandii hedges across Dundalk and County Louth over the past 35 years. Some have been well-maintained and perfectly reasonable. Others have been utter nightmares. Here is what you need to know about leylandii rules in Ireland, what your legal rights actually are, and what you can do if a leylandii hedge is causing you problems.

## The Big Difference: Ireland vs the UK

The first thing to understand is that Ireland does **not** have specific legislation dealing with high hedges, unlike the UK. In England and Wales, the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 (Part 8) gives local councils the power to order the reduction of hedges that are affecting the reasonable enjoyment of a neighbour's property. In Northern Ireland, the High Hedges Act (NI) 2011 provides similar protections.

In the Republic of Ireland, **no such law exists**. There is no specific hedge height limit, no statutory right to light in residential settings, and no dedicated complaints procedure for high hedges. This leaves homeowners in a much weaker position when dealing with an overbearing leylandii hedge on a neighbour's property.

It has been talked about in the Oireachtas on several occasions, and there have been private members' bills proposed, but as of 2026, no specific high hedge legislation has been enacted in the Republic.

## What Legal Options Do You Have?

While there is no dedicated high hedge law, that does not mean you are completely without options. Here are the legal avenues available:

### 1. The Common Law Right to Cut Overhanging Branches

You have the right to cut back any branches or roots that overhang or encroach onto your property, up to the boundary line. You are not required to ask your neighbour's permission to do this. However:

- You should return the cuttings to the hedge owner (or at least offer to)
- You cannot enter your neighbour's property to do the work
- You must not cause the tree or hedge to become unstable or unsafe
- Any damage to the hedge beyond the boundary line could leave you liable

### 2. Nuisance Claims

If a leylandii hedge is causing a genuine **nuisance** (a legal term), you may be able to take a civil action against the hedge owner. Nuisance in this context means an unreasonable interference with your use and enjoyment of your property. This could include:

- Significant loss of light to your home or garden
- Damage to your property from roots
- Blocking of drainage

Nuisance claims are brought through the Circuit Court or High Court and can be expensive. You would need to demonstrate that the interference is unreasonable and goes beyond what a normal neighbour should be expected to tolerate.

### 3. Planning Regulations

If a neighbour has planted a leylandii hedge as part of a development or in contravention of planning conditions, you may be able to raise the issue with your local planning authority. This is a narrow avenue and only applies in specific circumstances.

### 4. Mediation

Before going the legal route, mediation is well worth trying. The Mediators Institute of Ireland (MII) can help connect you with a qualified mediator. Many neighbour disputes are resolved through a single mediation session, which is far cheaper and faster than going to court.

## Talking to Your Neighbour

We know it is not always easy, but the best first step is always a direct conversation. Many people do not realise the impact their hedge is having on a neighbour's property. A polite approach, perhaps with a specific suggestion ("Would you be open to bringing the hedge down to 2 metres? I would be happy to contribute to the cost"), often gets a better result than you might expect.

Some tips for the conversation:

- **Pick the right time.** Do not raise it when either of you is stressed or in a hurry
- **Be specific about the problem.** "Your hedge is blocking light from my kitchen" is more constructive than "Your hedge is a disgrace"
- **Suggest a solution.** Offer to share the cost or recommend a professional who can do the work
- **Put it in writing.** If a verbal conversation does not work, a polite letter sets out the issue clearly and creates a record

If direct communication fails, a solicitor's letter may prompt action. Many hedge disputes are resolved at this stage without needing to go to court.

## Managing a Leylandii Hedge Properly

If you have a leylandii hedge yourself, the best thing you can do is keep it under control. A well-maintained leylandii at 2-3 metres is a perfectly reasonable garden hedge. It is only when they are let go that they become a problem.

### Trimming Schedule

Leylandii should be trimmed **two to three times per year** during the growing season:

- **First trim:** Late May to early June
- **Second trim:** Mid-July to early August
- **Third trim (optional):** September

### The Golden Rule: Never Cut Into Brown Wood

This is the critical thing about leylandii. Unlike laurel or privet, leylandii will **not** regenerate from old, brown wood. If you cut back beyond the green growth into the bare inner stems, that section will stay bare permanently. This means:

- You must keep on top of trimming every year
- Each trim should only remove the current season's green growth
- The hedge should never be allowed to grow beyond the point where you want it

Once a leylandii hedge has been let go and you need to reduce it significantly, you are often left with brown, bare sides that will never green up again. In many cases, the only real option at that stage is removal and replacement.

### Reducing Height Safely

If your leylandii has grown too tall but still has green growth on the sides, you can reduce the height, but with care:

1. **Take no more than one-third of the height** off in a single cut
2. **Leave a slightly domed or pointed top** rather than cutting flat, to avoid a flat, brown top
3. **Do the work in late spring or early summer** when the hedge is actively growing
4. **Feed and water** after cutting to help the hedge recover

For very tall hedges, this work requires professional equipment and experience. We have reduced leylandii hedges from 8-10 metres down to manageable heights many times, but it needs to be done carefully.

## Alternatives to Leylandii

If you are considering removing a leylandii hedge and replacing it with something more manageable, here are some alternatives that provide similar screening without the headaches:

- **Cherry laurel:** Fast-growing, evergreen, and can be cut back hard if needed. Grows 40-60cm per year.
- **Portuguese laurel:** A more refined option with darker leaves. Slower than cherry laurel but easier to manage.
- **Griselinia:** Excellent for coastal areas, moderate growth, needs trimming just once a year.
- **Thuja plicata (Western red cedar):** An evergreen conifer that is more forgiving than leylandii. It can regenerate from old wood to some extent and has a nicer, softer texture.
- **Yew:** Slow-growing but produces a dense, elegant hedge. Will regenerate from hard pruning, unlike leylandii.

## Removing a Leylandii Hedge

If a leylandii hedge is beyond saving or the decision has been made to remove it, here is what is involved:

1. **Check for wildlife.** Even leylandii can harbour nesting birds. Do not remove during the nesting season (March to August) without checking first.
2. **The hedge is typically cut down in sections** using a chainsaw, starting from the top and working down.
3. **Stump removal** is usually recommended, as leylandii stumps can be large. Stump grinding is the most efficient method.
4. **Root removal** may be needed if the roots are causing issues with foundations, drainage, or neighbouring properties.
5. **Disposal:** Leylandii generates a large volume of waste. Most of it can be chipped and composted, though it takes longer to break down than broadleaf hedge material.

The cost of removing a leylandii hedge varies depending on size and access, but for a typical domestic hedge, expect to pay somewhere in the region of EUR 500-2,000 depending on the length and height.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a legal height limit for hedges in Ireland?

No. Unlike England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland has no specific legislation setting a maximum hedge height. Your legal options are limited to common law rights (cutting overhanging branches) and nuisance claims through the courts.

### Can I force my neighbour to cut their leylandii?

You cannot directly force a neighbour to cut their hedge. You can cut back anything that overhangs your property. Beyond that, your options are mediation, a solicitor's letter, or a nuisance claim in court. There is no local authority complaints procedure for high hedges in Ireland.

### Will leylandii grow back if I cut it to the stump?

No. Leylandii will not regenerate from bare stumps or old brown wood. If cut back too hard, the only option is removal and replanting with a different species.

### How much does it cost to maintain a leylandii hedge?

For a leylandii hedge maintained at 2-3 metres, expect to pay for two to three professional trims per year. The exact cost depends on the length and accessibility, but for a typical domestic hedge, each trim might cost EUR 80-200. It is a significant ongoing commitment, which is why we often recommend alternatives to leylandii for new plantings.
