One of the first questions people ask when they are looking at an overgrown or neglected garden is "how much is this going to cost me?" It is a fair question, and honestly, the answer depends on quite a few factors. But we can give you a solid idea of what to expect based on our experience clearing gardens across Dundalk, Drogheda, and the wider County Louth area for over 35 years.

The truth is, garden clearance costs in Ireland can range from a couple of hundred euro for a small tidy-up to well over a thousand for a large property that has been neglected for years. Let us break it all down so you know exactly what you are paying for and how to get the best value.

## Typical Garden Clearance Prices in Ireland

Here is a rough guide to what you can expect to pay for professional garden clearance in 2026. These are based on real jobs we have completed in the northeast, so they reflect actual costs rather than guesswork.

| Garden Size | Typical Condition | Price Range |
|---|---|---|
| Small garden (under 30m2) | Light to moderate overgrowth | €200 — €500 |
| Medium garden (30-80m2) | Moderate to heavy overgrowth | €500 — €1,000 |
| Large garden (80-150m2) | Heavily overgrown | €1,000 — €1,500 |
| Very large or estate gardens | Severely neglected, multiple areas | €1,500 — €3,000+ |

These prices generally include labour, equipment, and waste removal. But every garden is different, which is why a proper on-site quote is always the way to go.

## What Affects the Cost of Garden Clearance?

### Size of the garden

This is the obvious one. A small courtyard garden in the centre of Dundalk is a very different job from a half-acre site out past Blackrock. More ground means more time, more labour, and more waste to shift.

### Level of overgrowth

A garden that has been left for one season is a world apart from one that has not been touched in five years. Light overgrowth — long grass, some weeds, a few unruly shrubs — is quick work. But thick brambles, self-seeded trees, and years of accumulated growth take significantly longer to clear.

### Type of vegetation

Not all plants are created equal when it comes to clearance. Grass and weeds are straightforward. Brambles are harder because the roots need digging out. Trees require cutting, sometimes stump grinding. And problem species like Japanese knotweed need specialist treatment that adds to the cost.

### Access to the garden

If we can drive a trailer or van right up to the garden, loading and removing waste is efficient. If everything has to be carried through the house, down steps, or along narrow side passages, the job takes longer and costs more.

### Volume of waste

Garden waste adds up fast. A single overgrown garden can produce 10 to 15 cubic metres of green waste, which all needs to be loaded, transported, and disposed of at a licensed facility. Disposal fees are part of the overall cost.

### Additional work required

Sometimes a straightforward clearance uncovers additional work — old fencing that needs removing, rubble or dumped materials buried under growth, or ground that needs levelling once cleared. These extras are hard to predict until the clearance starts, which is why a good service will keep you informed as the job progresses.

## What Should Be Included in a Garden Clearance Quote?

When you get a quote for [garden clearance](/services/garden-clearance/), make sure you understand what is and is not included. A good quote should cover:

- **Labour** — the cost of the crew and their time on site
- **Equipment** — strimmers, chainsaws, chippers, and any machinery needed
- **Waste removal** — loading, transport, and disposal at a licensed facility
- **Site clean-up** — leaving the garden tidy and ready for the next stage

Watch out for quotes that seem too cheap — they may not include waste disposal, which can leave you stuck with a mountain of green waste and nowhere to put it.

### What is usually not included

- Tree surgery or stump grinding (often quoted separately)
- Specialist treatment for invasive species
- Skip hire for non-organic waste like rubble or old concrete
- Any follow-up work like landscaping, turfing, or planting

Always ask for a clear breakdown so you can compare quotes properly.

## How to Save Money on Garden Clearance

### Do some of the prep yourself

If you can cut back the lighter growth — long grass, annual weeds, light shrub growth — before the professionals arrive, it reduces their time on site and can bring the cost down. Even bagging up loose debris helps.

### Combine jobs

If you are planning to have landscaping, fencing, or paving work done after the clearance, it can sometimes be more cost-effective to use the same team for everything. There are savings in having the equipment already on site and the team familiar with the garden.

### Book during quieter periods

Winter and early spring tend to be quieter months for garden services. You may find better availability and sometimes slightly lower rates compared to the busy summer months.

### Get multiple quotes

This goes without saying, but always get at least two or three quotes for any significant garden work. It helps you understand the going rate and ensures you are not overpaying. Just remember that the cheapest quote is not always the best — check that waste disposal is included and ask about insurance.

## How to Get an Accurate Quote

The best way to get a reliable quote is to have someone visit the site. Photos can help for an initial estimate, but there is no substitute for walking the ground and seeing the job in person.

When you contact a garden clearance service, be ready to share:

- The approximate size of the garden
- How long it has been overgrown
- What type of growth is there (grass, brambles, trees, etc.)
- Whether there is good vehicle access
- What you want the end result to be (cleared ground, ready for landscaping, etc.)

A reputable service will visit for free, walk the garden with you, and give you an honest assessment of what is needed and what it will cost. If someone quotes you over the phone without seeing the garden, that should be a red flag.

## Is Professional Garden Clearance Worth the Cost?

We understand that the cost of garden clearance can feel like a big outlay, especially if you are already planning further work on the garden. But consider what you are getting:

- A job that might take you several weekends of hard physical labour, done in a day or two
- Proper waste disposal handled for you — no trips to the recycling centre with a car full of brambles
- Professional equipment that makes the work safer and more thorough
- Advice on what to keep, what to remove, and what to watch out for
- A garden that is ready for its next chapter, whether that is a new lawn, [landscaping project](/services/garden-landscaping/), or simply a space you can enjoy

For many of the homeowners we work with across Louth, the biggest regret is not getting it done sooner.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a minimum charge for garden clearance?

Most professional services have a minimum charge to cover travel, equipment, and disposal costs. In the Dundalk area, you would typically be looking at a minimum of around €200 to €300 even for a small job. This usually covers a few hours of work and a load of waste removal.

### Can I get a grant or financial help for garden clearance?

There are no specific grants for garden clearance in Ireland. However, if you are doing clearance work as part of a larger renovation on an older property, it may fall under wider renovation or energy upgrade schemes. Your local authority may also have schemes for vacant properties that include garden work.

### Do garden clearance companies charge by the hour or by the job?

It varies. Some charge a day rate, others quote per job. We prefer to quote per job after seeing the site — that way you know exactly what you are paying and there are no surprises if the work takes a bit longer than expected. A day rate can sometimes work out more expensive if unforeseen issues come up.

### When is garden clearance cheapest?

Late autumn and winter tend to be the most affordable times. The ground is often softer (which helps with root removal), there is less active growth, and garden services tend to have more availability. Spring and summer are busier and can come with longer lead times.
