## Understanding Retaining Walls

### Purpose and Functionality

Retaining walls are essential structures that serve both practical and aesthetic purposes in landscaping. Their primary function is to restrain soil on a slope and prevent erosion, thereby transforming sloped terrain into usable space.

By managing the soil and creating different levels in a garden, retaining walls can enhance the visual appeal of outdoor spaces.

As garden features, retaining walls can also provide privacy, depending on their height. In addition to managing soil erosion and providing functional spaces, they can complement various landscaping styles and preferences.

### Types of Retaining Walls

There are various types of retaining walls, each with their unique design and method of retaining soil. Here, we will briefly discuss four common types: gravity wall, cantilever wall, sheet piling wall, and anchored wall.

**1\. Gravity Wall**

As the name suggests, a gravity wall relies on its own weight to withstand the pressure exerted by the soil on the slope. These walls are typically constructed from heavy materials such as stone, brick, or concrete. They can be designed to incorporate steps or as a [series of terraces](https://backyardscape.com/retaining-wall-ideas/) to create interesting layers within the landscape.

**2\. Cantilever Wall**

Cantilever walls are predominantly made of reinforced concrete and feature a T-shaped design. This type of wall takes advantage of the principle of leverage, using the weight of the soil behind it as a counterbalance. This makes cantilever walls an ideal choice for retaining soil on steeper slopes.

**3\. Sheet Piling Wall**

Constructed using materials such as steel, aluminium, or plastic, sheet piling walls are particularly useful in areas with soft soil and limited space. These walls are made by driving interlocking, vertical sheet piles into the ground. The key advantage of using sheet piling walls is their ability to withstand both lateral and vertical pressures.

**4\. Anchored Wall**

An anchored wall is similar to a regular retaining wall but uses an additional component, such as cables or rods, to increase its strength. These anchors are drilled into the soil and then secured to the wall using a mechanical or chemical method. Anchored walls are typically used in conditions where the retaining wall must withstand a higher load, like when dealing with [steep slopes, tall walls, or large amounts of soil](https://www.homebuilding.co.uk/ideas/retaining-wall-ideas).
