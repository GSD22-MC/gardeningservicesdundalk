When you are facing a garden full of overgrowth, old rubbish, or years of accumulated green waste, one of the first decisions you will need to make is how to get rid of it all. Most people in Ireland immediately think of hiring a skip, but there is another option that is often better value and far less hassle — hiring a professional garden clearance service.

We have been clearing gardens across Dundalk and County Louth for over 35 years, and we have seen plenty of customers who started with a skip and ended up calling us anyway. So let us lay out the honest comparison so you can make the right choice for your situation.

## Skip Hire — How It Works

When you hire a skip, a company delivers an open-top container to your property (or the road outside). You fill it with waste over a set period — usually a few days to a week — and they come back to collect it. Simple enough in theory.

### Typical skip sizes and prices in Ireland

| Skip Size | Capacity | Typical Cost (Louth) |
|---|---|---|
| Mini skip (2-3 yard) | About 20-30 bin bags | €150 — €250 |
| Midi skip (4-5 yard) | About 40-50 bin bags | €250 — €350 |
| Standard skip (6-8 yard) | About 60-80 bin bags | €300 — €450 |
| Large skip (10-12 yard) | About 100-120 bin bags | €400 — €600 |

These prices are for green waste and general garden waste. If you are mixing in soil, rubble, or heavy materials, expect surcharges.

### What you can put in a skip

Most skip hire companies accept:
- Green waste (grass, hedge trimmings, branches)
- Timber and old fencing
- General non-hazardous waste
- Light rubble (sometimes at extra cost)

### What you cannot put in a skip

- Hazardous materials (paint, chemicals, oils)
- Tyres
- Asbestos
- Electrical items
- Plasterboard (usually needs a separate skip)
- Soil is often restricted or charged extra

## Garden Clearance Service — How It Works

A professional [garden clearance](/services/garden-clearance/) service takes a completely different approach. A team arrives with all the equipment needed — strimmers, chainsaws, chippers, trailers — and they do everything. They cut, clear, load, and remove all the waste in one go. You point at what needs clearing, and they get on with it.

The waste goes straight into their vehicles or trailers and is taken to a licensed disposal facility on the same day. No skip sitting on your drive, no permit needed, and no heavy lifting on your part.

## The Real Cost Comparison

Here is where it gets interesting. At first glance, a skip seems cheaper. But when you add up all the costs, the picture changes.

### Skip hire — true cost breakdown

- Skip hire fee: €300 (for a standard 6-yard skip)
- Road permit from Louth County Council (if on public road): €40-50
- Your time clearing and loading: 2-3 full days for a medium garden
- Tool hire if needed (strimmer, chainsaw): €50-100 per day
- Fuel and trips if skip is not enough: €30-50
- Second skip if you underestimate volume: another €300

**Realistic total for a medium garden: €450 — €850+**

And that is before you count the value of your weekends and the physical toll of doing the work yourself.

### Garden clearance service — true cost

- Professional clearance including labour, equipment, and waste removal: €500 — €1,000 for a medium garden
- Your time: zero (beyond being there to let the team in)
- Additional costs: typically none, as waste disposal is included

**Realistic total for a medium garden: €500 — €1,000**

When you compare like for like, a professional service often comes in at a similar price — and sometimes cheaper — than the DIY-plus-skip approach. The difference is that you do not have to do any of the work.

## Pros and Cons Side by Side

### Skip hire pros
- Good if you want to work at your own pace over several days
- You control exactly what goes in
- Works well for mixed waste (garden waste plus household items)
- No need to be home when it is delivered or collected

### Skip hire cons
- You do all the physical work yourself
- Easy to underestimate how many skips you need
- Takes up space on your drive or road
- Needs a permit if on public property
- Cannot handle certain waste types
- Skip sits there for days, which neighbours may not love

### Garden clearance service pros
- Everything done for you — clearing, loading, disposal
- Usually completed in one or two days
- Professional equipment makes the job faster and more thorough
- No skip on your property
- No permit needed
- Waste is sorted and disposed of properly
- You get advice on what to keep and what to remove

### Garden clearance service cons
- You need to be available when the team is working
- Less flexibility on timing (you book a specific date)
- May not be ideal if you also have a lot of non-garden household waste to dispose of

## When a Skip Makes More Sense

There are situations where skip hire is genuinely the better choice:

- **Mixed clearance projects** — if you are clearing out a shed, garage, and garden all at once, a skip gives you one container for everything
- **Renovation work** — if there is rubble, old bathroom fittings, or construction waste alongside garden waste, a skip handles the mix
- **Slow and steady work** — if you want to chip away at the job over a week of evenings, having a skip sitting there is convenient
- **Very small jobs** — a mini skip for a few bags of garden waste can be the simplest option

## When a Clearance Service Makes More Sense

For most garden-specific jobs, a professional clearance service wins:

- **Overgrown gardens** — the team has the tools and experience to handle heavy growth that would take you days
- **Time pressure** — selling a house, preparing for tenants, or getting ready for a [landscaping project](/services/garden-landscaping/) means you need it done quickly
- **Limited access** — no room for a skip, or the garden is at the back with no side access
- **Heavy vegetation** — brambles, trees, and thick woody growth need proper equipment
- **You would rather not do it yourself** — there is nothing wrong with paying professionals to do a job they are equipped for

## The Hidden Costs of Skip Hire

A few things that catch people out:

- **Overloading penalties** — if you fill the skip above the rim, you will be charged extra or the company will refuse to collect it
- **Wrong waste surcharges** — putting restricted items in a green waste skip can result in the entire load being reclassified (and charged at a higher rate)
- **Multiple skips** — people almost always underestimate how much waste an overgrown garden produces. What you think will fill one skip often fills two
- **Damage to driveways** — heavy skips can crack block paving or tarmac, especially in wet weather

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I hire a skip and a clearance service together?

You can, but it is rarely necessary. A professional clearance service brings their own waste removal as part of the package. The only time you might want both is if you have a large mixed job with garden waste and household items — the team clears the garden, and you use the skip for everything else.

### Do I need a permit for a skip in County Louth?

If the skip is placed on a public road, footpath, or council-maintained area, yes — you need a permit from Louth County Council. If it is on your own private property (your driveway, for example), no permit is needed. The skip hire company can usually arrange the permit for you for an additional fee.

### How long does a garden clearance service take compared to filling a skip myself?

A professional team with proper equipment can clear a medium-sized overgrown garden in one to two days. Doing the same job yourself and filling a skip typically takes two to three full weekends of hard physical work, depending on the level of overgrowth.

### What if there is non-garden waste mixed in with the overgrowth?

This is common, especially in neglected gardens. Old fencing, broken concrete, plastic sheeting, and all sorts can be buried under years of growth. A good clearance service will separate and dispose of different waste types appropriately. We handle this all the time and it is factored into the quote.
