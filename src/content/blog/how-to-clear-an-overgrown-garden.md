There is something deeply satisfying about reclaiming a garden that has been left to run wild. Whether you have just moved into a new home in Dundalk, inherited a property, or simply let things slide over a few seasons, an overgrown garden can feel overwhelming at first glance. But with the right approach and a bit of patience, you can transform even the most tangled jungle back into a usable outdoor space.

We have been helping homeowners across County Louth tackle overgrown gardens for over 35 years, and in that time we have seen it all. From gardens buried under years of brambles to backyards where you cannot even see the back wall. The good news? Every single one of them was recoverable.

## Assess What You Are Working With

Before you reach for the strimmer, take a proper walk around the garden. Even if you have to fight your way through, it is worth understanding what you are dealing with.

### Things to look out for

- **Structures hiding underneath** — old paths, patios, raised beds, or garden walls may be buried under growth. You do not want to accidentally damage something worth keeping.
- **Trees and shrubs worth saving** — not everything needs to go. Mature trees, established hedging, and healthy shrubs can be pruned back rather than removed.
- **Problem plants** — brambles, Japanese knotweed, giant hogweed, and bindweed all need specific treatment. Knowing what you are dealing with early saves time and money.
- **Access points** — how will you get waste out of the garden? Is there side access, or will everything need to come through the house?

Give yourself a rough sketch or just take photos on your phone. It helps enormously when planning the work ahead.

## Gather Your Tools

If you are tackling this yourself, you will need more than a pair of secateurs and good intentions. Here is what we would recommend for a decent-sized overgrown garden:

- **Heavy-duty strimmer or brush cutter** — essential for getting through long grass, nettles, and light brambles
- **Loppers and a pruning saw** — for cutting back woody growth, overhanging branches, and thick stems
- **A good sharp spade** — for digging out roots, especially bramble roots
- **Rake and leaf blower** — to clear debris once the heavy cutting is done
- **Heavy-duty garden bags or a trailer** — you will be amazed at the volume of waste an overgrown garden produces
- **Gloves, eye protection, and sturdy boots** — seriously, do not skip the safety gear. Bramble thorns and hidden debris can cause nasty injuries

For larger jobs, a mini digger or a wood chipper makes a massive difference. That said, most people do not have those sitting in the shed, which is where a professional [garden clearance](/services/garden-clearance/) service comes in handy.

## Step-by-Step: Clearing the Garden

### Step 1 — Cut everything back to ground level

Start by strimming or brush cutting all the long grass, weeds, and light growth. This lets you see what is actually underneath. Work in sections so it does not feel too daunting.

### Step 2 — Remove brambles and woody growth

Once the ground-level stuff is cleared, tackle the brambles and heavier woody growth. Cut them back first with loppers, then dig out the root systems with a spade. Leaving bramble roots in the ground is a guarantee they will come back.

### Step 3 — Prune trees and shrubs

Now that you can see the bones of the garden, decide what stays and what goes. Overgrown shrubs can often be hard-pruned back to shape. Dead or damaged trees should be removed.

### Step 4 — Clear all the debris

Rake up cuttings, bag them, and get them off site. This is usually the most physically tiring part of the job. A typical overgrown garden in Dundalk can produce anywhere from 5 to 20 cubic metres of green waste.

### Step 5 — Deal with the ground

Once cleared, you will likely find the soil is compacted and full of roots. A good rotavation, some soil improver, and a bit of levelling will prepare the ground for whatever comes next — whether that is a new lawn, planting beds, or hard landscaping.

### Step 6 — Dispose of waste properly

Do not be tempted to burn everything or dump it in a field. Garden waste needs to be disposed of legally in Ireland. Your options include your local civic amenity site, green waste collection, or hiring a professional service that handles disposal for you.

## DIY vs Hiring a Professional

There is no shame in admitting a job is too big to handle on your own. Here is a rough guide to help you decide:

**DIY might work if:**
- The garden is small to medium (under 50 square metres of overgrowth)
- The growth is mostly grass, weeds, and light shrubs
- You have access to the right tools
- You have a way to dispose of the waste

**Hire a professional if:**
- The garden is large or severely overgrown
- There are brambles, trees, or problem species involved
- You need the job done quickly (for a sale, rental, or new build)
- You do not have a way to handle the waste volume

A professional team can typically clear a medium-sized overgrown garden in one to two days, compared to several weekends of hard graft doing it yourself.

## How Long Does Garden Clearance Take?

This depends on the size and condition of the garden, but here are some rough timelines based on our experience across Louth and the northeast:

| Garden Size | Condition | Typical Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Small (under 30m2) | Moderately overgrown | Half a day to 1 day |
| Medium (30-80m2) | Heavily overgrown | 1-2 days |
| Large (80m2+) | Severely neglected | 2-4 days |

These assume a two-person crew with proper equipment. Add extra time if there are trees to fell, stumps to grind, or heavy waste like rubble and old fencing.

## What Should You Keep?

One of the most common mistakes people make is clearing absolutely everything and starting from a blank canvas. While that works in some cases, established plants add instant maturity and value to a garden.

Consider keeping:
- Mature trees (especially native species)
- Established hedging that provides privacy
- Healthy perennials that will come back each year
- Any structural features like stone walls or old pathways

A good [garden clearance](/services/garden-clearance/) service will advise you on what is worth saving before the chainsaws come out.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to clear an overgrown garden in Ireland?

Costs vary depending on the size and condition of the garden, but for most domestic gardens in the Dundalk area, you are looking at between €300 and €1,200. Larger or severely neglected properties can cost more. We always provide a free quote after visiting the site so there are no surprises.

### Can I burn garden waste in my garden in Ireland?

Technically, you can burn dry garden waste on your own property in Ireland, but there are restrictions. Under the Air Pollution Act, you cannot burn waste in an urban area, and even in rural areas there are rules around timing and what you can burn. It is generally easier and safer to use a civic amenity site or hire a professional removal service.

### Do I need planning permission to clear my garden?

No, you do not need planning permission for standard garden clearance. However, if there are protected trees (covered by a Tree Preservation Order) or if the property is in a conservation area, you should check with your local authority first. Louth County Council can advise on any restrictions.

### What happens to the garden waste after clearance?

When you hire a professional service, the waste is typically sorted and taken to a licensed green waste facility where it is composted or recycled. Any non-organic waste like old fencing, concrete, or rubble is disposed of separately at the appropriate facility.
