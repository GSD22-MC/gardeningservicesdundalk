## Timber vs Composite Decking

We install both timber and composite decking in Knockbridge. Here's how they compare:

| Feature | Timber Decking | Composite Decking |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Cost | Lower upfront | Higher upfront |
| Maintenance | Needs annual treatment | Very low maintenance |
| Lifespan | 10–15 years with care | 25+ years |
| Appearance | Natural wood grain | Wood-effect finish |
| Slip resistance | Moderate (improves with treatment) | Good (textured surface) |

For Knockbridge gardens, both options work well. We'll help you choose based on your budget, how much maintenance you want to do, and the look you're after.

## Why Proper Installation Matters

A deck is only as good as its substructure. We build every deck on a solid framework of treated joists, properly spaced and ventilated. Key steps we follow:

1. **Ground preparation** — clearing, levelling and laying a weed membrane
2. **Support structure** — concrete pads or screw piles with treated timber frame
3. **Ventilation** — minimum 150mm clearance for airflow beneath the deck
4. **Board fixing** — correct spacing for expansion, hidden fixings where possible
5. **Finishing** — sanding edges, applying treatment (timber), adding trims

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does decking need planning permission in Knockbridge?
Most garden decking is exempt from planning permission if it's under 1 metre in height and within your rear garden. Decking attached to a listed building or in a conservation area may need approval. We'll advise you during the consultation.

### How long does decking installation take?
A standard deck (15–25m²) typically takes 2 to 4 days to complete. Larger or more complex projects with steps, levels or built-in features may take up to a week.

### Can you build decking on a slope in Knockbridge?
Yes — we regularly build raised and stepped decking on sloped sites around Knockbridge. We design the substructure to create a perfectly level surface even on uneven ground.

### Do you clean and restore existing decking?
Absolutely. We offer pressure washing, sanding and re-staining for tired timber decking. It's a cost-effective way to refresh your outdoor space without a full replacement.
