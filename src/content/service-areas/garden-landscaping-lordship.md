## Landscaping for Lordship Conditions

Lordship is a rural area on the southern slopes of the Cooley Mountains, and gardens here sit on sloped ground with mountain shelter. We take local conditions into account on every project:

**Hillside considerations:** The sloped terrain around Lordship means drainage, soil stability and access all need careful planning. We build solid retaining walls, create level terraces for seating and planting, and ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging on heavy clay.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does garden landscaping cost in Lordship?
Every garden is different. A small patio project might start from €2,000, while a full garden redesign typically ranges from €5,000 to €15,000+. We provide detailed written quotes so you know exactly what you're paying for before any work begins.

### How long does a landscaping project take?
A typical garden landscaping project takes 1 to 3 weeks depending on size and complexity. Larger projects with extensive hard landscaping may take longer. We'll give you a realistic timeline during the quotation stage.

### Do I need planning permission for landscaping in Lordship?
Most residential landscaping work is exempt from planning permission. However, significant changes to levels, boundary walls over 2 metres, or structures may require planning. We'll advise you on this during the consultation.

We landscape year-round, though spring and autumn are ideal for planting. Hard landscaping (patios, walls, paths) can be done any time the weather allows. The earlier you book, the sooner we can schedule your project.
