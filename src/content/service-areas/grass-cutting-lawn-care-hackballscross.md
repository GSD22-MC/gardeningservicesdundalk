## Why Hackballscross Lawns Need Regular Care

Gardens in Hackballscross sit on elevated rural ground with mixed conditions. The heavy, moisture-retentive soil means grass grows well here, but without regular cutting it quickly becomes unmanageable. During the Irish growing season (March to October), lawns in this area typically need cutting every 7 to 14 days.

We adjust our cutting height and frequency based on the time of year. In spring, we cut higher to encourage strong root growth. In summer, we maintain a medium height for a healthy, lush finish.

## What We Bring

We arrive with professional-grade equipment — no domestic lawn mowers here. Our kit includes:

- Commercial cylinder and rotary mowers for different lawn types
- Petrol strimmers for edges, around trees and along walls
- Leaf blowers for a clean finish after every visit
- All fuel, tools and materials included in the price

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I get my grass cut in Hackballscross?
During the growing season (April to September), we recommend cutting every 7 to 10 days. In early spring and autumn, fortnightly is usually enough. We can set up a regular schedule that works for you.

### Do you cut wet grass?
We avoid cutting in heavy rain as it damages the lawn and clogs equipment. If conditions are poor on your scheduled day, we'll rearrange for the next dry day at no extra charge.

### Can you handle overgrown gardens?
Absolutely. We regularly clear overgrown lawns in Hackballscross and the surrounding areas. We'll cut it back in stages to avoid shocking the grass, then get it on a regular schedule.

### Do you serve all of Hackballscross?
Yes — we cover all of Hackballscross and surrounding areas including Forkhill and Dromintee. We're based 15km northwest of Dundalk, so we're always nearby.
