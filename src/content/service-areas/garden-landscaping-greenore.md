## Landscaping for Greenore Conditions

Greenore is a small coastal community on the Cooley Peninsula, and gardens here sit on exposed coastal land with strong winds. We take local conditions into account on every project:

**Coastal considerations:** Gardens near the coast face salt spray, strong winds and sandy soil. We select wind-tolerant plants, use sturdy materials that resist salt corrosion, and design sheltered seating areas where you can enjoy the outdoors even on breezy days.

3. **Groundwork** — clearance, excavation, drainage and base preparation

### How much does garden landscaping cost in Greenore?
Every garden is different. A small patio project might start from €2,000, while a full garden redesign typically ranges from €5,000 to €15,000+. We provide detailed written quotes so you know exactly what you're paying for before any work begins.

Most residential landscaping work is exempt from planning permission. However, significant changes to levels, boundary walls over 2 metres, or structures may require planning. We'll advise you on this during the consultation.

We landscape year-round, though spring and autumn are ideal for planting. Hard landscaping (patios, walls, paths) can be done any time the weather allows. The earlier you book, the sooner we can schedule your project.
