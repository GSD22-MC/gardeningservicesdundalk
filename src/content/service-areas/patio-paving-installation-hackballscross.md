## How We Build a Patio

A patio that lasts starts with proper groundwork. Our process:

1. **Design and layout** — we mark out the patio area with string lines and check levels
2. **Excavation** — digging out to the correct depth (typically 200mm below finished level)
3. **Sub-base** — 100mm compacted MOT Type 1 stone for a solid foundation
4. **Mortar bed** — full mortar bed (not spot-bedding) for maximum support
5. **Slab laying** — careful placement with consistent joints and accurate levels
6. **Pointing** — joint compound or mortar pointing for a professional finish
7. **Clean-up** — we wash down the patio and remove all waste material

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a patio take to install in Hackballscross?
A typical 20m² patio takes 3 to 5 days to complete, including excavation and base preparation. Larger or more complex projects may take a week or more.

### Do I need planning permission for a patio?
Most garden patios are exempt from planning permission. However, if you're significantly changing ground levels or affecting drainage, it's worth checking with the local authority. We can advise during the consultation.

### What about drainage?
We always design patios with a slight fall (slope) to direct rainwater away from the house. Where needed, we install channel drains or connect to existing drainage systems.

### Can you lay paving over an existing patio?
In some cases, yes — if the existing patio is level and structurally sound. However, overlaying can raise the finished level, which may affect door thresholds or damp-proof courses. We'll assess this on site.
