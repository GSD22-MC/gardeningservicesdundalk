## Landscaping for Jenkinstown Conditions

Jenkinstown is a rural area near Jenkinstown Park and the Cooley Mountains, and gardens here sit on undulating farmland with sheltered gardens. We take local conditions into account on every project:

**Local considerations:** The moderately heavy loam in Jenkinstown gives us a good foundation to work with. We improve soil structure where needed, select plants suited to local conditions, and design gardens that look great year-round in the Irish climate.

### How much does garden landscaping cost in Jenkinstown?
Every garden is different. A small patio project might start from €2,000, while a full garden redesign typically ranges from €5,000 to €15,000+. We provide detailed written quotes so you know exactly what you're paying for before any work begins.

### How long does a landscaping project take?

### Do I need planning permission for landscaping in Jenkinstown?
Most residential landscaping work is exempt from planning permission. However, significant changes to levels, boundary walls over 2 metres, or structures may require planning. We'll advise you on this during the consultation.

We landscape year-round, though spring and autumn are ideal for planting. Hard landscaping (patios, walls, paths) can be done any time the weather allows. The earlier you book, the sooner we can schedule your project.
