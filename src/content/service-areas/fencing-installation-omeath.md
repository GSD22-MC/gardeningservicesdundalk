Need new fencing in Omeath? Pete & Seamus install all types of garden and boundary fencing across Omeath and County Louth. From a single panel replacement to a complete perimeter fence, we supply quality materials and install them properly so they last.

## Fencing Options for Omeath

We install a wide range of fencing styles to suit every property and budget:

### PVC / uPVC Fencing
Maintenance-free and long-lasting. PVC fencing won't rot, warp or need painting. Available in white, grey and woodgrain finishes. A popular choice in Omeath for front and rear gardens.

### Timber Panel Fencing
The classic garden fence. We use pressure-treated timber panels fitted to sturdy concrete or timber posts. Available in closeboard, lap panel and hit-and-miss styles for different levels of privacy.

### Post and Rail Fencing
A traditional countryside style, ideal for larger properties around Omeath. Available in timber or metal. Often used for boundary definition rather than privacy.

### Concrete Post and Panel
Extremely durable and low maintenance. Concrete gravel boards at the base prevent rot, while concrete posts mean no future post replacements. A smart choice for Omeath where coastal winds can test weaker fencing.

### Composite Fencing
A modern option that combines the look of timber with the durability of composite materials. No painting, no rotting, and available in a range of colours.

## Fencing Prices in Omeath

## Omeath Fencing Considerations

Coastal winds in Omeath put extra stress on fencing. We use deeper post holes (minimum 600mm), concrete post bases, and recommend solid panel or concrete fencing that handles exposure. Timber fencing near the coast needs regular treatment to prevent salt damage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the legal fence height in Omeath?
Garden fences up to 2 metres (6.5 feet) in your rear garden typically don't need planning permission. Front garden fences are limited to 1.2 metres. Always check with the local authority if you're unsure.

### How long does fencing take to install?
A typical garden (30–40 metres of fencing) takes 1 to 2 days. We can usually start within a week of your quote being approved.

### Do you take down old fencing?
Yes — we remove and dispose of old fencing as part of the job. We can also work with existing posts if they're still sound, which reduces cost.

### Can you install fencing on uneven ground?
Absolutely. We regularly install fencing on sloped and uneven sites in Omeath and the surrounding areas. We step the panels to follow the contour of the ground.
