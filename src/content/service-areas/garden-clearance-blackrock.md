## When You Might Need Garden Clearance

Gardens in Blackrock can become overgrown quickly, especially if a property has been unoccupied or a garden has been neglected. Common situations where we help:

- **Moving into a new home** with a neglected garden

- **Landlords** getting rental properties ready between tenants
- **After building work** — clearing construction waste from the garden
- **Seasonal clear-outs** — autumn leaf clearance and end-of-year tidy-ups

Coastal gardens in Blackrock often accumulate windblown debris, sand and salt-damaged plants that need regular clearing to keep the garden manageable.

## How We Work

1. **Free assessment** — we visit, walk the garden and agree what needs clearing
2. **Clearance day** — our team arrives with all the tools and equipment needed
3. **Systematic clearing** — we work through the garden methodically, separating recyclable green waste from general rubbish
4. **Waste disposal** — all waste removed from site. Green waste is composted; other waste goes to licensed facilities
5. **Finished garden** — we leave the space clear, tidy and ready for its next chapter
