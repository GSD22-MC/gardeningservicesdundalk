## Landscaping for Hackballscross Conditions

Hackballscross is a rural border village near the Armagh boundary, and gardens here sit on elevated rural ground with mixed conditions. We take local conditions into account on every project:

**Local considerations:** The heavy, moisture-retentive soil in Hackballscross gives us a good foundation to work with. We improve soil structure where needed, select plants suited to local conditions, and design gardens that look great year-round in the Irish climate.
