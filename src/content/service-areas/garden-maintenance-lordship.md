## Tailored to Lordship Gardens

Gardens in Lordship, a rural area on the southern slopes of the Cooley Mountains, have their own character. The local acidic clay soil typical of mountain foothills and sloped ground with mountain shelter create specific growing conditions that we understand well after years of working in the area.

We plan our maintenance visits around the seasons. In spring, we focus on preparation — clearing winter debris, pruning back, and getting beds ready for planting. Summer visits centre on mowing, weeding, and deadheading to keep everything looking fresh. Autumn means leaf clearance, cutting back perennials, and protecting tender plants. In winter, we handle structural pruning and tidying.
