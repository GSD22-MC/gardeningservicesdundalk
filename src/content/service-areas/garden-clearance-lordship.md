## When You Might Need Garden Clearance

Gardens in Lordship can become overgrown quickly, especially if a property has been unoccupied or a garden has been neglected. Common situations where we help:

- **Moving into a new home** with a neglected garden
- **Preparing to sell** — a tidy garden improves property value
- **Landlords** getting rental properties ready between tenants
- **After building work** — clearing construction waste from the garden
- **Seasonal clear-outs** — autumn leaf clearance and end-of-year tidy-ups

In Lordship, the wetter conditions on the hillside mean gardens can become overgrown rapidly. Brambles and native scrub can take over quickly if not managed.

## How We Work

1. **Free assessment** — we visit, walk the garden and agree what needs clearing
2. **Clearance day** — our team arrives with all the tools and equipment needed
3. **Systematic clearing** — we work through the garden methodically, separating recyclable green waste from general rubbish
4. **Waste disposal** — all waste removed from site. Green waste is composted; other waste goes to licensed facilities
5. **Finished garden** — we leave the space clear, tidy and ready for its next chapter

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a garden clearance take in Lordship?
A small to medium garden clearance typically takes half a day to a full day. Heavily overgrown gardens or larger properties may take 2 to 3 days. We'll give you a realistic timeline after the site visit.

### Do you dispose of all waste?
Yes — we take everything away. Green waste is separated for composting, and all other materials are disposed of at licensed facilities. We don't fly-tip or leave anything behind.

Absolutely. We regularly clear gardens in Lordship that haven't been touched in years. No job is too overgrown. We have the tools and experience to deal with heavy bramble, scrub, and accumulated rubbish.
