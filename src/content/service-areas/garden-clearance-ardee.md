## When You Might Need Garden Clearance

Gardens in Ardee can become overgrown quickly, especially if a property has been unoccupied or a garden has been neglected. Common situations where we help:

- **Moving into a new home** with a neglected garden
- **Preparing to sell** — a tidy garden improves property value
- **Landlords** getting rental properties ready between tenants
- **After building work** — clearing construction waste from the garden
- **Seasonal clear-outs** — autumn leaf clearance and end-of-year tidy-ups

The fertile rich, loamy soil typical of the midlands in Ardee means vegetation grows vigorously — an untended garden can become a serious project within a single growing season.

3. **Systematic clearing** — we work through the garden methodically, cutting back and clearing all overgrowth
