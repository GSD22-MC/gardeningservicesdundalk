## Landscaping for Blackrock Conditions

Blackrock is a popular seaside village south of Dundalk, and gardens here sit on flat coastal land with exposed gardens. We take local conditions into account on every project:

**Coastal considerations:** Gardens near the coast face salt spray, strong winds and sandy soil. We select wind-tolerant plants, use sturdy materials that resist salt corrosion, and design sheltered seating areas where you can enjoy the outdoors even on breezy days.

2. **Design proposal** — we present a clear plan with materials, planting and costs
3. **Groundwork** — clearance, excavation, drainage and base preparation
4. **Hard landscaping** — patios, walls, paths, steps and structures
5. **Soft landscaping** — soil preparation, planting, turfing and finishing
6. **Handover** — we walk you through your new garden and provide aftercare advice

We landscape year-round, though spring and autumn are ideal for planting. Hard landscaping (patios, walls, paths) can be done any time the weather allows. The earlier you book, the sooner we can schedule your project.
