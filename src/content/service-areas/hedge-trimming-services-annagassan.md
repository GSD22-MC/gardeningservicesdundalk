## When to Trim Hedges in Ireland

Timing matters both for the health of your hedge and for wildlife:

- **March to August:** Nesting season — we check for nesting birds before cutting (it's illegal to destroy nests under the Wildlife Act)
- **Late summer (August–September):** Ideal time for a clean trim on most hedges
- **Late winter (January–February):** Best for hard pruning and renovation of deciduous hedges
- **Year-round:** Light tidying and shaping is fine any time

We always check for nesting birds before starting work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should hedges be trimmed in Annagassan?
Most garden hedges need trimming 2 to 3 times per year. Fast growers like privet and leylandii may need more frequent attention. We can set up a regular trimming schedule so you never have to worry about it.

### Can you reduce an overgrown hedge?
Yes. We regularly reduce hedge height and width for customers in Annagassan. Most hedges can be cut back hard and will recover well. We'll advise if gradual reduction is better for the species.

### Do you remove hedge clippings?
All clippings are removed as part of our service. We take them away for composting or proper disposal.

### Is there a time of year you can't trim hedges?
We avoid heavy cutting during bird nesting season (March to August) where possible, as required by the Wildlife Act 2000. Light tidying and shaping is usually fine, but we always check for active nests first.
