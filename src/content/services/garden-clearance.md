### Fast, Efficient Service

Most garden clearances are completed in 1-2 days, depending on the size and condition of the garden. We bring all the equipment we need — from chainsaws and hedge trimmers to trailers for waste removal. Everything is disposed of properly, with green waste recycled wherever possible.

### What Happens After Clearance

Once your garden is cleared, you have a blank canvas. Many of our customers choose to follow up with landscaping, new turfing, paving, or fencing. We can handle the full transformation — from clearance through to the finished garden. If you're not sure what to do next, we're happy to advise on options that suit your space and budget.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does garden clearance cost in Dundalk?

The cost depends on the size of the garden, the density of the overgrowth, and how much waste needs to be removed. Small garden tidy-ups can cost from around €200, while full clearances of large overgrown gardens may range from €500 to €1,500+. We provide a free site visit and quote so you know exactly what to expect.

### How long does a garden clearance take?

Most garden clearances are completed in 1-2 days. Very large or heavily overgrown gardens may take a little longer. We'll give you a clear timeline during our free site visit so you know what to expect.

### Do you remove all the waste from a garden clearance?

Yes. We remove every scrap of waste from the site — green waste, rubble, old fencing, and any other rubbish. Your garden is left clean, tidy, and ready for whatever you want to do next. Waste removal is included in our quote with no hidden charges.

### Can you clear an inherited or rental property garden?

Absolutely. This is one of our most common requests. Whether you've inherited a property with a neglected garden, or you're a landlord preparing a rental for new tenants, we can clear the garden quickly and get it looking presentable. We deal with estate agents, solicitors, and landlords regularly.

### Can you do a partial clearance?

Yes. Not every garden needs a full clearance. If you only need certain areas tidied up — like clearing an overgrown border, removing a dead tree, or cutting back a section of the garden — we can do that too. Just tell us what you need during our site visit.

### What areas do you cover for garden clearance?

We cover Dundalk and all of County Louth, including Blackrock, Ardee, Carlingford, Castlebellingham, Annagassan, Omeath, Lordship, Knockbridge, and all surrounding areas.
