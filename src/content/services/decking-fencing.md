## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does decking cost in Dundalk?

Decking costs depend on the size of the area, the materials chosen, and the complexity of the design. Timber decking is typically more affordable upfront, while composite decking costs more but requires less maintenance over time. We provide free quotes with a breakdown of all costs so there are no surprises. As a rough guide, a standard deck area can start from around €1,500.

### What's the difference between timber and composite decking?

Timber decking uses natural wood and needs periodic staining and treatment to maintain its appearance and resist rot. Composite decking is made from a mix of wood fibres and recycled plastic — it requires minimal maintenance, won't rot, and keeps its colour for years. Composite costs more upfront but saves time and money on upkeep.

### How long does fencing installation take?

Most garden fencing jobs are completed in 1-2 days, depending on the length of the run and the type of fencing. We remove old fencing, install new concrete posts and gravel boards where appropriate, and leave the site tidy. Larger boundary fencing projects may take 2-3 days.

### Do you remove old fencing and decking?

Yes. We remove and dispose of all old fencing, decking, and posts as part of the job. This is included in our quote — there are no hidden charges for waste removal.

### Can you build decking on a sloped garden?

Yes. Sloped gardens are actually ideal for decking — a raised or multi-level deck can turn an awkward slope into a usable outdoor living space. We'll design and build the deck to suit the gradient of your garden, with proper drainage and structural support.

### What areas do you cover for decking and fencing?
