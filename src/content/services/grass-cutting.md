### Why Regular Lawn Care Matters

Irish weather means grass grows fast — especially between March and October. Without regular cutting, lawns can quickly become overgrown, patchy, and full of weeds and moss. A consistent cutting schedule keeps your lawn thick, green, and healthy. We use professional-grade mowers and strimmers, and always clean up after every visit.

### Flexible Scheduling

We know every homeowner has different needs. Some prefer a weekly cut during the growing season, others need a fortnightly visit. We also offer one-off cuts for overgrown lawns, holiday cover, or before special occasions. Whatever suits you — we'll work around your schedule.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does grass cutting cost in Dundalk?

Prices depend on the size of your lawn and how often you'd like it cut. Regular weekly or fortnightly cuts are the most cost-effective option. We provide free quotes so you'll know the exact price before we start. Most standard residential lawns in Dundalk cost between €25 and €50 per cut.

### Do you offer regular grass cutting contracts?

Yes. Most of our customers are on a regular schedule — either weekly or fortnightly during the growing season (March to October). We turn up on the same day each week, and you don't need to be home. There's no long-term contract — you can cancel anytime with notice.

### What's the best time of year to scarify a lawn in Ireland?

The best time to scarify your lawn in Ireland is in early autumn (September-October) or early spring (March-April). This removes the buildup of dead grass (thatch) and moss, allowing air, water, and nutrients to reach the soil. We recommend scarifying at least once a year for a healthy lawn.

### Can you cut an overgrown lawn?

Yes. If your lawn hasn't been cut in weeks or months, we can bring it back under control. We use professional equipment to cut long grass in stages, avoiding damage to the lawn. Once it's back to a manageable height, we can set you up on a regular cutting schedule to keep it looking great.

### Do you remove the grass clippings?

Yes, we collect and remove all clippings as standard. Leaving clippings on the lawn can smother the grass and encourage moss growth. We leave your lawn clean and tidy after every visit.

### What areas do you cover for grass cutting?

We cover all of Dundalk and County Louth, including Blackrock, Ardee, Carlingford, Castlebellingham, Annagassan, Omeath, Louth Village, Jenkinstown, and all surrounding areas.
