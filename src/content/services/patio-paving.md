### The Importance of Proper Foundations

The difference between a patio that lasts 20 years and one that sinks after 2 years is all in the preparation. Every paving project we do starts with proper excavation, a compacted sub-base, and correct drainage falls. We never cut corners on groundwork — it's the foundation of everything we build, and it's why our work stands the test of time.

### Materials We Work With

We supply and install a wide range of paving materials, including Indian sandstone, limestone, granite, porcelain, and concrete block paving. We'll help you choose the right material for your project based on your budget, the look you want, and practical considerations like slip resistance and maintenance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does a patio cost in Dundalk?

Patio costs depend on the size of the area, the type of paving material, and the amount of groundwork needed. As a rough guide, a standard rear patio using quality natural stone can range from €3,000 to €8,000 depending on size. We provide free, detailed quotes so you know exactly what to expect.

### How long does it take to lay a patio?

Most patio installations take between 3 and 7 days, depending on the size and complexity of the project. This includes excavation, sub-base preparation, laying the paving, and pointing/grouting. We'll give you a clear timeline during our free site visit.

### What paving material is best for an Irish climate?

Natural stone (sandstone, limestone, granite) performs very well in the Irish climate. It handles frost, rain, and temperature changes without cracking. Porcelain paving is also an excellent choice — it's extremely durable, low-maintenance, and slip-resistant. We'll advise on the best option for your specific situation.

### Do you lay block paving driveways?

Yes. We lay block paving driveways in a range of patterns and colours. We handle the full job — excavation, sub-base, edging, laying, and compaction. Block paving is a popular choice for driveways because it's durable, attractive, and allows for easy repair of individual blocks if needed.

### Can you repair a sunken or damaged patio?

Yes. If individual slabs have sunk, cracked, or become uneven, we can lift and relay them on a proper base. In some cases, a full re-lay may be more cost-effective than patching. We'll advise on the best approach after inspecting your patio.

### Are you insured for paving work?

Yes, we are fully insured for all paving and patio installation work. This includes public liability cover for any work carried out on your property.
