### When to Trim Your Hedges

In Ireland, the best times to trim most hedges are in late spring (May-June) after nesting season, and again in late summer (August-September) for a tidy finish going into winter. Note that under the Wildlife Act, it is illegal to cut hedgerows during nesting season (1 March to 31 August) — though garden hedges are generally exempt. We always advise checking for nesting birds before any work begins.

### Professional Equipment, Clean Results

We use commercial-grade hedge trimmers, long-reach cutters, and access equipment for tall hedges. Every job is finished with a full clean-up — all cuttings are removed and your property is left spotless. No mess, no fuss.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does hedge trimming cost in Dundalk?

The cost depends on the size, height, and condition of your hedge. Small front garden hedges can cost as little as €50-€80 to trim, while large boundary hedges or overgrown hedges may cost €150-€400+. We provide free, no-obligation quotes so you know the exact price before we start.

### How often should hedges be trimmed in Ireland?

Most hedges need trimming 2-3 times per year to stay neat and dense. Fast-growing species like leylandii and laurel may need more frequent attention. We can set you up on a regular schedule so your hedges always look their best.

### Can you reduce the height of a large hedge?

Yes. We regularly reduce the height and width of large hedges that have grown out of control. This is best done in stages for some species to avoid shock. We'll advise on the best approach during our free site visit.

### Do you remove all the hedge cuttings?

Yes, all cuttings and waste are removed from your property and disposed of responsibly. Your garden will be left clean and tidy. This is included in our quote — no hidden charges for waste removal.

### Can you remove a hedge completely?

Yes. We can remove hedges completely, including the stumps and roots. The area can then be cleared and prepared for fencing, planting, or landscaping. We also offer new hedge planting if you want to replace an old hedge with a different species.

### What areas do you cover for hedge trimming?

We cover Dundalk and all of County Louth — including Blackrock, Carlingford, Ardee, Castlebellingham, Annagassan, Omeath, Lordship, and all surrounding towns and villages.
