## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does decking cost in Dundalk?

Decking costs depend on the size of the area, the materials chosen, and the complexity of the design. Timber decking is typically more affordable upfront, while composite decking costs more but requires less maintenance over time. We provide free quotes with a breakdown of all costs so there are no surprises. As a rough guide, a standard deck area can start from around €1,500.

### What's the difference between timber and composite decking?

Timber decking uses natural wood and needs periodic staining and treatment to maintain its appearance and resist rot. Composite decking is made from a mix of wood fibres and recycled plastic — it requires minimal maintenance, won't rot, and keeps its colour for years. Composite costs more upfront but saves time and money on upkeep.

### Do you remove old decking?

Yes. We remove and dispose of all old decking as part of the job. This is included in our quote — there are no hidden charges.

### Can you build decking on a sloped garden?

Yes. Sloped gardens are actually ideal for decking — a raised or multi-level deck can turn an awkward slope into a usable outdoor living space. We'll design and build the deck to suit the gradient of your garden, with proper drainage and structural support.

### What areas do you cover for decking?

We cover Dundalk and all of County Louth, including Blackrock, Carlingford, Ardee, Castlebellingham, Omeath, Lordship, Louth Village, and all surrounding areas.
